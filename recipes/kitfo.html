    <h1>Steps</h1>
    <h3>Steps to Make Kitfo:</h3>
    <ol>
        <h5>Prepare the Ingredients:</h5>
        <li>Ensure the minced beef is fresh and finely chopped. If not pre-minced, you can mince it yourself using a sharp knife or a meat grinder.</li>
        <li>Melt the niter kibbeh in a small saucepan over low heat.</li>
        
        <h5>Mix the Ingredients:</h5>
        <li>In a large bowl, combine the minced beef with the melted niter kibbeh.</li>
        <li>Add the mitmita powder (or ground cardamom), salt, and cayenne pepper (if using). Mix thoroughly to ensure the beef is well coated with the spices and butter.</li>
        
        <h5>Cook the Kitfo (Optional):</h5>
        <li>Kitfo is traditionally served raw, but you can lightly cook it if preferred. To cook, heat a skillet over medium heat and add the seasoned beef mixture.</li>
        <li>Stir the beef mixture constantly for about 1-2 minutes until it is just browned on the outside but still rare inside. Do not overcook.</li>
        
        <h5>Serve the Kitfo:</h5>
        <li>Transfer the kitfo to a serving dish.</li>
        <li>Serve it with injera or kocho, and optional sides like ayib and gomen.</li>
        <li>Enjoy this delicious Ethiopian delicacy!</li>

    <h2> Description </h2>
            <p> Injera is a traditional Ethiopian and Eritrean flatbread with a unique, slightly spongy texture. 
            Made primarily from teff flour, a gluten-free grain native to the region, injera is both a staple 
            food and an essential part of the dining experience in these cultures.</p>
    <h1> Ingredients </h1>
        <h3> All you need to make traditional Injera is: </h3>
        <ul>
            <li>teff flour (or some plain flour or rice flour) </li>
            <li>water </li>
            <li>salt </li>
            <li>vegetable oil or ghee for cooking </li>
        </ul>

        <h1>Steps</h1>
        <h3>Steps to Make Injera:</h3>
        <ol>
          <h5>Mix the Batter:</h5>
          <li>Combine teff flour and water in a large bowl to form a smooth batter.</li>
          <li>Optionally, add a small amount of starter culture to aid fermentation.</li>
        
          <h5>Ferment the Batter:</h5>
          <li>Cover the bowl with a clean cloth and let the batter ferment at room temperature for 2 to 3 days.</li>
          <li>Stir the batter occasionally. The batter should become slightly bubbly and develop a mildly sour aroma.</li>
        
          <h5>Prepare for Cooking:</h5>
          <li>Once fermented, stir the batter and add a pinch of salt.</li>
          <li>Adjust the consistency by adding water if necessary. The batter should be pourable but not too thin.</li>
        
          <h5>Heat the Pan:</h5>
          <li>Preheat a non-stick or cast-iron skillet over medium-high heat.</li>
          <li>Lightly grease the skillet with a small amount of oil or wipe it with a paper towel dipped in oil.</li>
        
          <h5>Cook the Injera:</h5>
          <li>Pour a ladleful of batter into the center of the hot skillet, then quickly tilt the skillet to spread the batter evenly into a thin, round layer.</li>
          <li>Cook the injera until bubbles form on the surface and the edges begin to lift from the pan. This typically takes about 1-2 minutes.</li>
          <li>Do not flip the injera; it cooks only on one side. When the top surface is set and the edges start to lift, remove the injera from the pan.</li>
        
          <h5>Cool and Serve:</h5>
          <li>Transfer the cooked injera to a clean cloth or plate to cool.</li>
          <li>Repeat the cooking process with the remaining batter.</li>
          <li>Serve the injera with a variety of Ethiopian or Eritrean dishes, using it to scoop up stews, vegetables, and other accompaniments.</li>
        </ol>
